SSL encryption: Firebase enforces SSL encryption for data in transit, securing the communication between client devices and Firebase servers, preventing unauthorized access or eavesdropping.

Authentication and access controls: Firebase provides robust authentication and access control mechanisms, including options for email/password authentication, social media logins, and integration with third-party identity providers. It also offers fine-grained access controls to manage user permissions and roles within the app.

Firebase Security Rules: Firebase Security Rules enable developers to define rules for controlling access to data and services in Firebase, allowing only authorized users to access specific resources based on their roles and permissions.
Firebase Authentication Providers: Firebase supports various authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more, which offer secure authentication options for users to log in to Firebase-powered apps using their existing accounts.

Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database rules: Firebase provides Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database rules that allow developers to specify read and write permissions at the document, collection, or field level, ensuring data security and access control.

App-level security measures: Firebase allows developers to implement additional security measures at the app level, such as implementing secure communication protocols, encrypting sensitive data, and implementing server-side validation to protect against malicious activities.

Monitoring and logging: Firebase provides monitoring and logging features that allow developers to track and analyze usage, detect anomalies, and identify security threats.

Regular security updates: Firebase is backed by Google's robust security infrastructure, which includes regular security updates and patches to protect against known security vulnerabilities.
